# Do Americans feel secure about their jobs ?
Every month, the University of Michigan updates their [surveys of consumers](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php) in which they collect the people's opinion on their current financial situation. One of the questions respondants are asked is:
"During the next 5 years, what do you think the chances are that you (or your husband/wife) will lose a job that you wanted to keep ?".
